**Unit 4: Institutions** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to some of the most powerful and
influential social institutions: family, religion, education, and
government. First, you will study the institution of family. Did you
know the number of unmarried couples in the United States grew from
fewer than 1 million in the 1970s to 6.4 million in 2008? Now,
cohabiting couples account for 10 percent of all opposite-sex couples in
the United States! This information is significant to sociologists (and
you) because these numbers indicate dramatic changes in the structure of
the American family.*  
  
 *Next you will take a look at religion. Religion, like family, is yet
another significant indicator of social structures within a culture. It
is important to note that you will be studying religion from a
sociological perspective, not a religious perspective. For instance,
sociologist Émile Durkheim studied the functions of religion within a
society. Durkheim found that some people use religion for healing and
faith, others use it for communal bond, and even others may use it for
understanding “the meaning of life.” All of these functions of religion
will affect the society’s structure and balance.*  
  
 *You will also study the American school and educational systems. In
sociology, we understand education to be both a social problem and a
social solution. You will learn how schools can be agents for social
change – tools that can break even poverty or racism – as well as how
education can be a social problem, like when schools become drop-out
factories due to low funding or high levels of institutional
disorganization. In addition, we often observe political and religious
opposition to specific curriculum in schools, such as adequate sex
education or the concept of evolution. These are the kinds of questions
sociologists consider when studying schools and education.*  
  
 *Finally, you will learn about government and politics as well as work
and the economy from a sociological perspective. In these sections, you
will be challenged to define* power *– is it something you are born
into? Is it something you earn? Who decides your level of social power?
You will study power, work, and economy (one of the world’s earliest
social structures) by exploring various types of economic systems and
their functions in societies.*
