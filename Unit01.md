**Unit 1: Introduction to Sociology** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the discipline of sociology.
You will learn about the development of sociology as a field of research
and discover various theoretical perspectives central to the study of
society. You will also take a look at the process of sociological
research and explore different ethical concerns social scientists and
researchers face in their work. In addition, you will learn why it is
worthwhile to study sociology and how sociology can be applied in the
real world.*  
  
 *For example, did you know that sociologists helped the Supreme Court
end “separate but equal” racial segregation in the United States? It
might also interest you to know that the Reverend Martin Luther King,
Jr., Ronald Reagan, Robin Williams, and First Lady Michelle Obama, were
all sociology majors.*  
  
 *Sociologists have helped change and mold the social world we know
today, and sociology continues to be an exciting topic to study because
it teaches people how they fit into the bigger picture of society. We
can look at ourselves through a sociological perspective to see how we
classify ourselves and how others classify us. This is an invaluable
tool for living and working in an increasingly diverse and globalized
world.*
