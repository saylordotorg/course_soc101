**Unit 3: Social Inequality** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will address the growing concerns of global and
national inequality. You will explore questions like how did wealth
become concentrated in some nations? And how can we address the needs of
the world’s population when we live in a world with more than 7 billion
people?*  
  
 *You will also be introduced to institutionalized inequalities, such as
racism, sexism, and ageism, and delve into questions like how do our own
prejudices guide our interactions? And how might we overcome our
preconceived notions that lead to prejudice?*  
  
 *In addition, we will discuss the differences between sex and gender,
along with issues like gender identity and sexuality. In this phase of
the unit, we will explore various theoretical perspectives on sex and
gender in order to demonstrate a description of the topics as well as
alleviate bias from the description (not always an easy feat).*

     1. Apply functionalist, conflict theory, and interactionist
    perspectives to social stratification. How are they different? Which
    one do YOU think is most beneficial when studying social
    stratification? Why?  
      
     2. Explain the differences between stereotypes, prejudice, and
    discrimination. Provide examples for each.  
      
     3. Due to the current racial stratification in the U.S., how might
    race or ethnicity affect access to valuable resources like education
    or health care?  
      
     4. What is the difference between sex and gender? How, as
    sociologists, might we explain the *social construction* of
    gender?  
      
     5. Discuss various attitudes associated with sex and sexuality. How
    have these attitudes changed over the past several decades? Have we
    reached a point of equality? Provide some examples to support your
    argument.  
      
     6. Regarding the elderly population in America, what are some
    special concerns this population is facing?  
      
     7. What are the differences between the biological, social, and
    psychological changes associated with the aging process?  
      
     Posting and responding on the discussion board should take
    approximately 8 hours.
