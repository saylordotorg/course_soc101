**Unit 2: Culture, the Socialized Self, and the Individual in Society**
<span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will expose you to some of the most fascinating aspects of
sociology. You will be introduced to such sociological concerns as
culture, social interaction, groups and organizations, deviance and
social control, and media and technology. As you explore these areas of
sociological study, you will gain insight into some of the most common
unwritten rules for behavior in our social world. Then, you will
investigate why these social rules are so significant in our everyday
interactions. For example, what would happen if you deliberately
distrusted social order by committing even a minor social offense like
cutting in line, walking backwards, or wearing two different shoes? It’s
the unwritten rules (or normative behaviors) that do not permit this
kind of deviance without reactions (sometimes hostile) from social
actors.*  
  
 *Finally, you will be given the opportunity to think critically about
how technology has affected our social interactions as well as how it
has affected deviant behavior. Think about Facebook. While it is a
virtual interactive world, it has very much impacted our social
thinking. For example,* friend *has been turned into a verb, and we can
use Facebook to* like *something, bridging our lives and experiences
with hundreds of others in seconds.*
