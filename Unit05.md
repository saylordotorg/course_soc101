**Unit 5: Social Change and Social Issues** <span id="5"></span> 
*In your final unit for the course, you will learn about the great
social issues surrounding health care, urbanization, and social
movements. The sociology of health encompasses social epidemiology,
disease, mental health, disability, and medicalization. You will
discover that the way we perceive and treat medicine and health care
constantly evolves. Furthermore, as you study the sociology of health,
you will be challenged to answer questions like: What does health mean
to you? How do you feel about legalized drugs? And are too many people
on prescription medicines in America?*  
  
 *Also, in this unit, you will read about population, urbanization, and
the environment. You will explore possible reasons for the migration of
people from rural areas to urban areas as well as how these shifts in
population and urbanization may affect the environment.*  
  
 *Lastly, you will study different types of social movements. Social
movements are typically of a large scale and have great social impact;
although, they usually start out as grassroots organizations, relying
heavily on word of mouth. Grassroots movements that gain success,
however, often become institutionalized and evolve into a more fixed and
formal part of the social structure.*  
  
 *For example, the Second Wave of Feminism, which occurred from the
1960s through the 1980s, started as a grassroots movement to fight
against inequalities between the sexes. Men and women who participated
in this movement typically did not belong to formal organizations.
Instead, they spread the word of their cause through conscious-raising
groups in hopes of creating social change. One such group was destined
to become the National Organization for Women (NOW). Started by a group
of about 28 women in 1966, NOW remains one of the prominent political
and social voices for women’s rights today with a membership of over
500,000. Indeed, we are still witnessing changes instigated by the
Second Wave of Feminism, such as stronger legislation protecting women
from discrimination in the workplace and from abuse in the home.*  
  
 *As you take a closer look at social movements, you will explore the
questions: How does collective behavior affect social change? How does
social change differ on state, national, and global levels? And how do
different theoretical perspectives interpret social movements?*
